as i cradled the phone against my cheek, an asian buddhist nun in plain brown robes walked past.
shut up, you're asian, you have genetics on your side.
i realized i was fat for an asian girl was when i was 10 years old, on a trip.
i started to wonder if i was the only asian girl who felt this way.
so we used a lot of asian flavors and twisted it all together.
you only have to look at all the asian immigrants who do not speak well and are completely uneducated.
i would not expect a 120 lb asian to be as interesting in the ring as either of them.
they are also trying to enter some middle eastern and asian markets, but no time frame has been given on those.
the improved ratings for asian universities are to be expected.
our town has a sizable asian population, whether you like it or not.
