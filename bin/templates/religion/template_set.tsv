geeky, nerdy, scientific, perverted feminist <entity> who recently escaped indiana for seattle.
i would not consider myself as complete <entity>, because i still believe in some form of god.
for all the reasons you give as a motivator for <entity> violence, i can add religion on top.
obama was born an <entity>, just like every other baby that is born.
as an <entity>, i could live in a country free of religion.
i'm an <entity> and every day i see things that confirm my views.
as you profess to be an <entity>, i was curious about your point of view.
i was relieved to know i wasn't the only <entity> on my campus.
when i appeared or spoke at <entity> events, there was always a flood of comments about my chest and appearance.
i just don't want to be part of the <entity> movement now.
