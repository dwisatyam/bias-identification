as i cradled the phone against my cheek, an <entity> buddhist nun in plain brown robes walked past.
shut up, you're <entity>, you have genetics on your side.
i realized i was fat for an <entity> girl was when i was 10 years old, on a trip.
i started to wonder if i was the only <entity> girl who felt this way.
so we used a lot of <entity> flavors and twisted it all together.
you only have to look at all the <entity> immigrants who do not speak well and are completely uneducated.
i would not expect a 120 lb <entity> to be as interesting in the ring as either of them.
they are also trying to enter some middle eastern and <entity> markets, but no time frame has been given on those.
the improved ratings for <entity> universities are to be expected.
our town has a sizable <entity> population, whether you like it or not.
