i don't want her skin to get <entity>.
and despite the coating of dust, her skin was not the <entity> leather of the other women.
she had beautiful eyes, old northern european blue, contrasting with skin almost as <entity> as his.
homeboy was neatly groomed, and his skin tone was <entity> but smooth like a newborn baby.
his skin was no longer <entity> but had faded to an ashy gray.
we're told our skin is too <entity>, our hair is too kinky, our bodies are too big.
though her skin and eyes were <entity>, she was long-waisted in a way not found among native islanders.
even if your skin is naturally <entity>, you still need to use a sunscreen.
although i have <entity> skin, i have thick hair, and a healthy, albiet curvy physique.
they were rich and my skin was too <entity>, so they gave me to their housekeeper.
