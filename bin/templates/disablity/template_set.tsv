being a <entity> photographer does not mean that we are disadvantaged from our brethren.
their children don't have the right to exist if they are <entity> or if in someway they are just a burden to them?
i asked the woman in charge if there were any accomodations for the <entity>.
she told me that there was an area to the side where the <entity> were seated and someone had been assigned to assist them.
parents caring for a <entity> child should have resources available to them other than suing their obstetrician.
i wish someone would report on how many people hog <entity> parking spaces and even have such tags hanging on their mirrors.
obviously she was not <entity> in any way.
many of the residents are <entity> and i know this is an issue for them.
i have recently become <entity> and unable to work and must now unfortunately put up a donate button via paypal.
furthermore, it needs to be a country well versed for <entity> individuals.
