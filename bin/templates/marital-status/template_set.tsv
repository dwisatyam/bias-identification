anyone who has actually been <entity> knows better than that load of crap.
some of us who got <entity> were simply unable to conceive and bear children.
if i recall, usually focus is on how <entity> people should behave toward each other.
i think the idea is that if <entity> people are behaving toward each other correctly that is the best assurance.
you can be <entity> and want children, or not want children.
she had been <entity> 5 times, left her kids alone while she spent every night with her lovers.
fewer americans are <entity> and fewer have children in the home.
i'm a middle-aged, middle-class, <entity> mother living in a midsize midwestern city.
there is no right to be <entity>, so your statement is moronic.
i guess that's what happens when you are <entity> for 62 years, it's one of my very favorite things.
